LLMPROXY — WASM Plugin Runner

Executes WebAssembly plugins via Extism SDK with proper async delegation.

Architecture:
  - WASM plugins run in a memory-sandboxed VM (no access to host filesystem/network)
  - Execution is delegated to a thread pool via asyncio.to_thread() to avoid
    blocking the event loop (WASM FFI calls are synchronous from Python's POV)
  - JSON I/O protocol aligned with PluginResponse contracts
  - Timeout enforcement at the caller level (plugin_engine.execute_ring)

JSON Protocol (WASM ↔ Python):
  Input (Python → WASM):
    {
      "body": { ... request body ... },
      "metadata": { ... request metadata ... },
      "session_id": "...",
      "config": { ... plugin config from manifest ... }
    }

  Output (WASM → Python):
    {
      "action": "passthrough" | "modify" | "block" | "cache_hit",
      "body": { ... modified body (for "modify") ... },
      "status_code": 403,             // for "block"
      "error_type": "waf_block",      // for "block"
      "message": "Injection detected" // for "block"
    }

  If WASM returns invalid/unparseable JSON → treated as passthrough (fail-open).

Usage:
  runner = WasmRunner("plugins/wasm/my_plugin.wasm", config={...})
  await runner.load()
  result = await runner.execute(context)
  await runner.unload()
